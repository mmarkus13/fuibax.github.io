### Original repo: https://github.com/fuibax/fuibax.github.io

### I've converted the assets to be usable in the game. <br/>To use them they need to be copied into the HotA.lod file via [mmarchive.exe](https://github.com/GrayFace/Misc/releases/download/MMArchive-1.3.1/MMArchive.rar) tool.

#### If you'd like to further customize/replace some of the assets to you liking I suggest checking the filenames & corresponding hero names here:<br/> [https://heroes.thelazy.net/index.php/Hero_portraits](https://heroes.thelazy.net/index.php/Hero_portraits)
